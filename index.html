            </h1>
            <p>
                Hi there! My name is Natasha Kravchuk. My handsome husband, Vadim, and I started Natasha’s Kitchen in 2009 and develop recipes and recipe videos full time together.

                I come from a family of fantastic cooks and I’m here to share generations of recipes that are homey, fresh, healthy, family-friendly, authentic, and  adventurous. Most importantly, our recipes taste great and you can trust that they actually work.

                every  night, that’s  just not  going to  happen. The   solution?  These 3 easy  dinner  recipes 
                that require minimal effort (or fancy chef skills) and taste delicious. From 15-minute pasta
                recipes to one-pan chicken wonders, we’ve got you covered.

                <h2>Best Way to Grill Sausages</h2>
                <p class="sec4-p">
                    On top of all that, sausages are inexpensive (they're made with cheap cuts, like shoulder and trimmings); are available in convenient serving-sized packages; and, even at the crummiest of supermarkets, come in at least a half dozen flavors.

                <h2>Your Grill for Better Skewers, Kebabs</h2>
                <p class="sec4-p">
                    Even if you've never visited a kebab shop in Istanbul, or been spellbound by the chicken sorcery of a yakitori chef in Tokyo, odds are you've come across a professional skewer-grilling setup at some point in your life.

                <h2>Meet the Empanadas of Latin America</h2>
                <p class="sec4-p">
                    Live rabbits hopped out of some of the large empanadas; birds fluttered from others." That's how food historian Rachel Laudan, in her book Cuisine and Empire, describes a feast eaten by Hernán Cortés and the Spanish Viceroy in Mexico City in 1538.
